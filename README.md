# Tea Box

I built this tea box for my soon-to-be Mother in Law, Jeanne Milton. I wanted to carve this box from two solid pieces of wood using the CNC and use a linked hinge for visual interest and mechanical complexity.

The lid is made from hard maple and the base is padauk. Since this is a food contact item, I finished it with a food-safe mineral oil and beeswax mixture.
